    <p>"Top 10 Web Design Styles of 1993"</p>

      <li>I find the point he makes about how most people who want to design websites, won't actually study interface design but will choose to study graphic design instead. I can relate to that.</li>
      <li>Prof. Dr webpages have a very basic "unstyled (with CSS)" visual style. Quoting the article, "Prof. Dr. doesn't mean at all that the site was made in 1993 and last time updated in 1995. The opposite. They are usually updated with a list of courses for the current semester or contain links to contemporary services like Google Calendar, twitter or embed Google Maps."</li>
          
      <li>It's interesting that back in the day, people had to set preferences like colours, fonts, links themselves. It allows for great flexibility, but it is also very tedious.</li>
