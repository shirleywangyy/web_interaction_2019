    <h1>READING 3</h1>
    <p>"Websites Are The Art Of Our Times"

      <li>I find it interesting that the author describes websites as "social" entities, pointing out their interactive traits like the ability to evaluate, criticize and "link" to each other.</li>
      <li>(For my own refernece) - telic means “something directed or tending towards a goal or purpose; purposeful”. For example “I am driving my car to Los Angeles” is a Telic statement. Telos, in Greek, means “the end” or “the purpose”. Do some websites lose their telic traits over time?</li>
