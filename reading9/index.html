      <li>I like the point Apple makes about not letting branding hinder great app design i.e. content and function - "Resist the temptation to display your logo throughout your app. Avoid displaying a logo throughout your app unless itâ€™s necessary for providing context. This is especially important in navigation bars, where a title is more helpful"</li>
      
      <li>Apple recommends using only a single typeface if possible throughout an app design </li>
      <li>Handmade websites as a form of resistance?</li>
    </ol>
