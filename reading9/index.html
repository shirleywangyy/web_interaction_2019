      <li>Handmade web - web pages coded by hand rather than by software; are made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations.</li>
      <li>Similar to handmade print items e.eg. zines, pamphlets, artists books</li>
      <li>It's interesting that in the early days of the web, people would build websites as their own online ideentity, rather than being depeendent on a few big sites (Facebook) to host their identity. </li>
      <li>Hnadmaking a website is definitely intense manual labour and having attempted to code my own, very basic websites, I have a whole new appreciation for the developers that have to do it for a living. </li>
      <li>Handmade websites as a form of resistance?</li>
