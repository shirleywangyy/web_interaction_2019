       <p>Dialogue (2010) is an emblematic painting of Lee’s recent eponymous series, which consists of minimal marks placed on a white gesso ground. The limited number of discrete strokes made with a broad, flat brush loaded with gray paint positioned in charged configurations on expanses of white unpainted ground evokes a generative emptiness. Created as an act of intense concentration guided by an ethics of restraint, Dialogue emphatically affirms the painting’s own physicality, as well as the infinite.</p>
