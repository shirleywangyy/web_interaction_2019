       <p>This work belongs to a series that Lee made by painting long downward lines until the paint on the brush is used up. He then returned to the top and started again. Describing his method, Lee wrote: ‘Load the brush and draw a line. At the beginning it will appear dark and thick, then it will get gradually thinner and finally disappear ... A line must have a beginning and an end. Space appears within the passage of time, and when the process of creating space comes to an end, time also vanishes’.</p>
